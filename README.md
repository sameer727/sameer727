<h3 align="center">Aspiring Backend & Product-Focused Developer | Startup-Ready 🚀</h3>

🎯 Currently focused on building **real projects fast**, even before mastering all concepts — because I believe in learning by shipping.

🔧 Tech I've touched recently:
- **JavaScript, Node.js, React**
- **Firebase, Supabase, Vercel**
- **SQL basics, REST APIs**
